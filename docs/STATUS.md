# code-evolve — Injectability Status Report

**Date:** 2026-06-29 (updated; original assessment 2026-06-28; issue table synced to 0.2.0's shipped state on 2026-08-05 — all P0–P3 landed per CHANGELOG #36–#55)
**Question:** How close is `code-evolve` to being an *installable function* that can be dropped into **any** GitHub repo — regardless of language or maturity — to "turn on" autonomous evolution, with a guided install that picks an LLM, interviews the user to produce the artifacts, and wires up local and/or GitHub Action execution on a chosen schedule?

---

## Verdict: publish-ready for the Claude happy path

Both original **P0 functional blockers are resolved** and the guided-install layer
landed (interactive agent/auth picker, `vision` + `spec` interviews wired into `init`,
execution-mode selector, configurable schedule, unified `setup` wizard). The package
builds, ships `dist/` + `templates/`, has a passing unit suite, and installs cleanly
end-to-end. **code-evolve 0.2.0 is ready to publish.**

The **core evolution engine is solid** for the happy path (a Claude user; a JS/TS/
Python/Rust repo — committed *or* greenfield; run locally or via GitHub Actions).
Stack detection is data-driven, file installation is collision-safe, and both a
cron-based local scheduler and a per-agent CI path exist.

Every issue in the original backlog below (P0–P3) has shipped. The only open issue
is [#8](https://github.com/frankbria/code-evolve/issues/8) (a *future* AI-video
delight feature). Remaining genuinely-future work, none of it a blocker: stack
breadth beyond the current set, and live end-to-end runs of the non-Claude backends
under real credentials (the adapter invocations are verified against the current
CLIs, but a billed one-shot per backend hasn't been exercised in CI).

---

## What already works

| Area | State |
|------|-------|
| **Stack detection** | `detect_stack.sh` emits build/test/lint/format as JSON per stack; supports Rust, JS/TS (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun), Python (uv/poetry/pip), Go, Makefile, and 1-level monorepos. Verifies scripts exist before emitting commands. |
| **Non-destructive install** | Workflows use skip-if-exists; `.gitignore` appended with a marker guard; state files preserved on re-init. Won't clobber an existing repo's files. |
| **Local execution** | `code-evolve start` installs a real Unix **crontab** entry (survives reboots), writes a 0600 `.env`, gitignored. `stop` removes it cleanly. |
| **CI execution** | `templates/workflows/evolve.yml` runs the engine on a cron + `workflow_dispatch` (but see P0.1). |
| **Multi-agent architecture** | 4 adapters ship (claude/codex/ollama/opencode); selection via `--agent`, persisted to `config.json`, sourced by `evolve.sh`. All four verified against the current CLIs as of 0.2.0 (#50); Claude is the most exercised end-to-end. |
| **Vision interview** | `code-evolve vision` runs a 10-question interactive interview → `vision.md`; LLM-drafted via the configured agent and offered right after `init` (#41, #42). |
| **PROOF9** | Optional requirements-ledger / quality-gate subsystem. Not required for injectability. |
| **Test suite** | Jest unit suite (19 tests) + 13 hermetic shell tests in `tests/` driving the real compiled CLI (jest runs in CI; shell tests target Linux/macOS/Git Bash + python3). |

## Gaps by dimension

### 1. Functional blockers (advertised feature literally doesn't work)
- ~~**CI workflows install to `.github/workflows/evolve/`** — GitHub Actions only executes workflows directly in `.github/workflows/`, so nested workflows never ran.~~ **RESOLVED in #36** — workflows now install directly into `.github/workflows/` as `evolve.yml`/`evolve-ci.yml`. Per-agent CI landed in #37 — `--with-ci` now templates `evolve.yml` for the configured agent (CLI install + `AGENT`/`MODEL` + the right secret); only `ollama` is skipped as local-only. → **P0.1 done**
- ~~**Greenfield abort.** `evolve.sh` ran `git rev-parse HEAD` under `set -euo pipefail`; on a freshly `git init`'d repo with no commits this exited non-zero and killed the session before any work.~~ **RESOLVED in #38** — `evolve.sh` now guards `git rev-parse --verify -q HEAD` and seeds a `--allow-empty` baseline commit before capturing `SESSION_START_SHA`, so greenfield repos bootstrap without aborting. → **P0.2 done**

### 2. Guided installation (the "turn on" experience — the heart of the ask)
- ~~No interactive **LLM/agent picker**; `init` silently defaults to `claude`/`api-key`.~~ **DONE** (#20) — `init` prompts for agent + auth on a TTY; flags/non-TTY skip it. → **P1.1**
- ~~No **spec generator** — `spec.md` is always hand-written.~~ **DONE in #40** — `spec` command runs a guided interview. → **P1.2**
- ~~`init` never offers to generate artifacts; the `vision` interview is disconnected and undocumented.~~ **DONE in #41** — `init` offers both interviews on a TTY. → **P1.3**
- ~~The interview is **hardcoded string Q&A, not the LLM interviewing the user**.~~ **DONE in #42** — interviews draft via the configured agent, falling back to static templates. → **P1.4**
- ~~No **execution-mode selector** (local / CI / both); `--with-ci` and `start` are disjoint, no persisted mode.~~ **DONE in #43** — `--mode local|ci|both` persisted in config. → **P1.5**
- ~~**Schedule is not configurable at install**: local is `--every <hours>` only; CI cron is hardcoded `0 */4 * * *` in the template.~~ **RESOLVED in #44** — `code-evolve init --every <hours>` now applies the chosen cadence to both the templated CI `cron:` and the local cron entry (prompted on a TTY). → **P1.6 done**
- ~~No **unified setup wizard** chaining picker → interview → mode → schedule.~~ **DONE in #45** — `setup` is re-runnable via auto-`--force`. → **P1.7**

### 3. Breadth & correctness (works on more repos, correctly)
- ~~CI provisions only Node/Python toolchains — **Rust/Go/JVM builds fail in CI**.~~ **RESOLVED in #46** — both `ci.yml` and `evolve.yml` now detect the stack(s) up front and conditionally install Rust (`dtolnay/rust-toolchain`), Go (`actions/setup-go`), and Java/Kotlin (`actions/setup-java`) toolchains; monorepos install each needed one. Java/Kotlin gating is inert until detection lands (#28). → **P2.1 done**
- ~~Large class of stacks fall through to "unknown" (no verification): **Java/Kotlin, C#/.NET, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, Deno, static sites**.~~ **DONE in #47** — detectors added for those stacks. → **P2.2**
- ~~`evolve.sh` blindly appends `--quiet` to build/test commands → **false "build has issues" for Go/Make/pip**.~~ **DONE in #48** — invocation is stack-aware (no blind `--quiet`). → **P2.3**
- ~~Agent **error detection is Claude-JSON-specific** (`evolve.sh:476`) — codex/ollama/opencode failures pass undetected.~~ **RESOLVED in #49** — the main session now captures `run_agent`'s real exit code (no longer masked by `tee`) and flags a failure on non-zero exit OR a per-adapter `agent_detect_error` marker (Claude keeps its `"type":"error"` grep; other adapters defer to exit code). → **P2.4 done**
- ~~codex/opencode/ollama adapter invocations are **unverified against the real CLIs** (e.g. Codex now uses `codex exec`).~~ **RESOLVED in #50** — adapters rewritten and verified against the current CLIs: codex uses `codex exec -m … -s workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check`, opencode uses `opencode run -m provider/model`, ollama uses `ollama run MODEL` (stdin); each carries a pinned "verified against \<version\>" comment. → **P2.5 done**
- ~~Skills are greenfield/spec-driven; **no instruction to discover & honor an existing mature repo's conventions**.~~ **DONE in #51** — skills/IDENTITY honor an existing repo's conventions when the spec is blank. → **P2.6**

### 4. Package polish & accuracy
- ~~**`npm test` is broken** — jest declared but not installed, zero test files.~~ **DONE in #53** — jest suite added (19 tests) and `npm test` fixed. → **P3.1**
- ~~**CLAUDE.md & package.json drift** — CLAUDE.md lists 4 commands (code ships 9) and flat skills (actually 5 dirs); package.json missing `keywords`/`homepage`/`bugs`.~~ **DONE in #54/#55** — CLAUDE.md slimmed to import AGENTS.md; README command table completed. → **P3.2**
- ~~**`schedule.json` is dead config** (written/displayed but never consumed); `--force` help text is misleading.~~ **RESOLVED in #35** — `schedule.json` documented as display-only metadata (read by `status`/`stop`; cron gates cadence, not this file); `--force` help corrected to "Bypass sponsor bonus-run gate". → **P3.3 done**
